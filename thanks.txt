It's time to blast off to space!

My 2nd file for the Mods J@m Camp tourNament! I put a lot more effort into tHe backgrounds this time, but I think it may be about the same level of difficulty as Lionheart (my other file in this tournament, if you are unaware).

It was fun to learn about effectmagnitude (lifesaver) and continue to refine my easing skills.

Thanks to 
- Taronuke for putting on this tournament 
- Condor and Halcyoniix for creating/sharing the zoom code
- oatmealine for troubleshooting (finding effectmagnitude for me)
- zun

and

- You for playing my files :)

I can't believe I've only done files for Mod Rushes/Jams. I should really create a file outside of these, huh?
